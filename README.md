# BBC News Labs Internal Bootstrap

This is a BBC News Labs theme for Bootstrap designed for internal tools.

It takes visual cues from existing internal CMS software like Vivo, iBroadcast and iSite. 

e.g. http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/a4ff8c67-7b3c-322c-b771-d43323b221cb

This theme was created with Themestrap, see README-themestrap.md for details.

## How to use it

To install this theme with Bower just run:

    bower install https://github.com/BBC-News-Labs/bbcnewslabs-internal-bootstrap#master

# Other useful resources

For JavaScript support - needed by some interactive elements - you will probably also want to include Bootstrap JavaScript (which requires jQuery).

You can find these hosted on the Google and Boostrap CDN's:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

You might to add Font Awesome for scalable, vector icons:

    <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>

NB: If you want your JavaScript and styles to work offline, you'll want to grab them locally (e.g. add them to your project with bower).
